                    to purchase a product/ service from us, you will receive an e-mail confirming receipt of your order

                    E-mail for each package, and each Dispatch Confirmation E-mail and corresponding dispatch will
                    conclude a separate contract of sale between you and us for the product(s) specified in that
                    Dispatch Confirmation E-mail.<br>
                    Your contract is with us (the Sellers) and you authorize us to declare and provide declaration to
