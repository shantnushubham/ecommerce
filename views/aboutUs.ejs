                        Educational institutions are laden with challenges and ‘effective procurement channels and
                        procedures’ continues to be on the top of the list. Institutions, big and small, continue to
                        rely on local markets for their needs and procure material through vendors who are either known
                        to them, or available in the nearby markets. Given the plethora of requirements of products and
                        services, the dependency on select and varied channels continues to be a cause of stress.
                        Institutions face difficulties in sourcing products that range from cleaning solutions to
                        sanitation to lab solutions to hardware, gardening, stationary and so on and so forth.
                        <br><br>

                        Wouldn’t it be good if somebody could eliminate some of the pain points? Wouldn’t it help if
                        institutions are not required to go hunting for their procurement needs every now and then? What
                        if somebody assures the ‘quality’ and ‘cost’ aspects and also ensures that the right products/
                        services are available to the institutions at the ‘right time’? The bottom line is – Educational
                        institutions need a ‘revolution’, when it comes to easing their procurement process!
                        <br><br>

                        <span class="big">112cart.com</span>, is, in fact, the revolution. Our purpose is to “To
                        revolutionize the procurement process of Educational Institutions in India by focusing on
                        Purity, Transparency and Convenience”. Our mission is to become a one-stop solution provider for
                        educational institution across India and remove the bottlenecks that the sector faces, when it

                        <br><br>

                        We’ve been there and done that! With over 5 decades of experience, having served the education
                        sector, we have analyzed the nuances of procurement, visualized the need for convenience and
                        transparency and are now taking some bold steps in the direction. Our eCommerce portal
                        <span class="big">112cart.com</span> is the first step in the revolution that we intend to bring

                    <p>
                        112, its inspiration comes from the ancient Indian vedic scripture “Vijñāna BhairavaTantra”,
                        which is a discourse between Bhairava (Lord Shiva) and Bhairavi (Goddess Parwati)and briefly
                        presents 112 techniques of meditation for self-realization. It is a gift for mankind,to
                        understand life and self-actualize through service.
                        <br><br>

                        112cart.com strives to find inspiration from the same goal of spirituality and believes that
                        everything in this world, from business to service, should be done with ‘purity’. Purity in
                        business and service is our motto, which is evident from the tagline “Service is Salvation”, for

                        Purity is to be a part of something that contributes first and gets the benefit as a
                        by-product!<br>
                        Purity is to work without the stimuli of greed and fear!
